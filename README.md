Some examples to illustrate design pattern implementation

</br>
<h2>Strategy Pattern</h2>
<b>Definition:</b> In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. The strategy pattern:
	-defines a family of algorithms,
	- each algorithm, and
	-makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.</br>
<b>Ex:</b> Calculate strategy (plus and minus example)

</br>
<h2>Observer Pattern</h2>
<b>Definition:</b> The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
</br>
<b>Ex:</b> Notify when attribute change

</br>
<h2>Decorator Pattern</h2>
<b>Definition:</b> In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class
</br>
<b>Ex:</b> Coffee shop, when we composite a coffe with addons
</br>

</br>
<h2>Factory Method Pattern</h2>
<b>Definition:</b> In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.
</br>
<b>Ex:</b> Set Phone and Table prices using two differents factory
</br>

</br>
<h2>Abstract Factory Pattern</h2>
<b>Definition:</b> Same as Factory Method Pattern but we just use one factory to create two differents types
</br>
<b>Ex:</b> Set Phone and Table prices using the same factory
</br>

</br>
<h2>Singleton Pattern</h2>
<b>Definition:</b> The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object, we need to get instance of the object to use the object
</br>
<b>Ex:</b> Servlet
</br>

</br>
<h2>Command Pattern</h2>
<b>Definition:</b> The command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
</br>
<b>Ex:</b> Control lights house using "ON" and "OFF" commands
</br>

</br>
<h2>Adapter Pattern (Wrapper)</h2>
<b>Definition:</b> The adapter pattern is a software design pattern (also known as Wrapper) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface
</br>
<b>Ex:</b> Chemical Components
</br>

</br>
<h2>Facade Pattern</h2>
<b>Definition:</b> A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.
</br>
<b>Ex:</b>
